She tried traditional UGC creators, but the cost was prohibitively expensive, and the quality was inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>That's when she discovered AdMaker AI.

According to a recent report by Meta, video ads are expected to account for 80% of all online advertising by 2027.</p>\n\n<p>To stay ahead of the curve, businesses should focus on creating high-quality, authentic-looking content that resonates with their target audience.
